# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves migrating from Perplexity API to Google's Gemini API for plant recommendation functionality. The key enhancement is that Gemini API will not only provide plant names and descriptions but also generate superimposed images showing how each suggested plant would look when placed in the user's original photo. This maintains all existing features while adding visual plant placement capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive plant recommendations using Gemini 2.0 Flash model instead of Perplexity API, so that I can get more accurate and comprehensive plant suggestions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a photo and location data THEN the system SHALL use Gemini 2.0 Flash model to analyze the image and location
2. WHEN Gemini 2.0 Flash processes the request THEN the system SHALL return plant recommendations in the same format as before
3. WHEN the API migration is complete THEN all existing functionality SHALL remain unchanged
4. IF Gemini API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error messages

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see superimposed images of suggested plants in my original photo, so that I can visualize how each plant would look in my specific location.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Gemini 2.0 Flash returns plant suggestions THEN each plant SHALL include a superimposed image showing the plant placed in the original photo
2. WHEN superimposed images are generated THEN they SHALL maintain realistic proportions and positioning
3. WHEN multiple plants are suggested THEN each SHALL have its own unique superimposed image
4. IF image superimposition fails THEN the system SHALL still return plant suggestions without the superimposed images

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the plant recommendation response to include both original plant data and superimposed images, so that I have comprehensive information for decision making.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN plant recommendations are returned THEN each plant SHALL include name, description, care instructions, and care tips
2. WHEN superimposed images are available THEN they SHALL be included in the plant data structure
3. WHEN the response is formatted THEN it SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing frontend code
4. IF additional plant data is available from Gemini 2.0 Flash THEN it SHALL be included in the response

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure Gemini 2.0 Flash API credentials securely, so that the application can authenticate with Google's services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up Gemini 2.0 Flash API THEN the system SHALL use environment variables for API keys
2. WHEN API credentials are stored THEN they SHALL not be exposed in code or logs
3. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL validate Gemini API connectivity
4. IF API credentials are invalid THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the community matching feature to continue working with Gemini-generated plant data, so that I can still connect with other users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN plant data comes from Gemini 2.0 Flash API THEN the community matching algorithm SHALL continue to function
2. WHEN users are grouped THEN the system SHALL use the same plant categorization logic
3. WHEN community responses are generated THEN they SHALL maintain the existing data structure
4. IF plant data format changes THEN the community matching SHALL adapt accordingly

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want basic error handling for Gemini 2.0 Flash API integration, so that the application remains stable during development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Gemini 2.0 Flash API calls fail THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error responses
2. WHEN API responses are malformed THEN the system SHALL handle gracefully
3. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide user-friendly error messages
4. IF API quota is exceeded THEN the system SHALL inform the user appropriately
