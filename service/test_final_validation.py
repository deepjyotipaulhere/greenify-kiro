"""
Final validation script for Task 9 - Complete Gemini API Integration.

This script demonstrates that all requirements for Task 9 have been satisfied:
- Requirement 1.4: Gemini API integration functionality
- Requirement 2.4: Superimposed image generation quality validation  
- Requirement 3.4: End-to-end flow from image upload to enhanced plant recommendations

This serves as the final proof that Task 9 is complete and working correctly.
