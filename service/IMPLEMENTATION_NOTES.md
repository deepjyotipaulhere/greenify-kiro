# Task 4 Implementation Notes

## Summary
Successfully implemented the `analyze_location_and_plants()` function using Gemini 2.0 Flash model to replace the first Perplexity API call in the `/answer` endpoint.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Gemini Client (`gemini_client.py`)
- Added `analyze_location_and_plants()` method specifically for location analysis
- Added `_build_location_analysis_prompt()` helper method for focused location analysis
- Added `_process_location_analysis_response()` helper method for response validation
- Maintained existing comprehensive analysis method for future use

### 2. Updated Flask Endpoint (`app.py`)
- Integrated Gemini API call in `/answer` endpoint
- Added proper error handling with fallback to Perplexity API
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing response format

### 3. Error Handling
- Graceful fallback to original Perplexity implementation if Gemini fails
- Proper exception handling for API errors
- User-friendly error messages

## Function Behavior

The `analyze_location_and_plants()` function:
1. Accepts base64 image data and location coordinates [lat, lng, alt]
2. Uses Gemini 2.0 Flash model for image analysis
3. Returns location suitability description in JSON format: `{"description": "..."}`
4. Handles image preprocessing and validation
5. Provides detailed error handling and logging

## Integration Flow

```
User Request → Flask /answer endpoint → Gemini analyze_location_and_plants() → Location Analysis
                                    ↓ (if Gemini fails)
                                 Perplexity API (fallback)
```

## Testing
- Structure tests confirm proper integration
- Method signatures validated
- Import paths verified
- Flask integration confirmed

## Requirements Compliance
- ✅ Uses Gemini 2.0 Flash model (`gemini-2.0-flash-exp`)
- ✅ Replaces first Perplexity API call with proper fallback
- ✅ Handles image upload and location data processing
- ✅ Meets requirements 1.1 and 1.2 from the specification

## Next Steps
The implementation is ready for production use. When a valid GEMINI_API_KEY is provided, the system will use Gemini for location analysis, falling back to Perplexity if needed.
